name: ws-resume
description: The single verb for advancing a unit at any stage — run it right after ws-start (it reads the unit's charter and plans from the design), to continue a half-done unit's tasks, or to ship a finished one; it also reopens a gone worktree and reconciles a drifted base. Idempotent — safe to run anytime, it does the next right thing for the state it finds. You know which unit; for deciding which unit comes next, that is ws-next.

# ws-resume — resume a unit

**Required first:** load the `ws` skill — it is the shared contract (SPEC) this skill references throughout.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` = `[unit-id]`. If omitted, infer it from the current worktree's branch by scanning `<store>/*/units.md` (store root: SPEC).

## Steps
1. Resolve the unit via the SPEC bare-slug resolver → `ws-id`, `repo`, `branch`. (With no argument, infer the unit from the current worktree's branch.)
2. Ensure the worktree exists and self-locate into it (SPEC "Command scope"):
   - already inside it (branch matches) → continue;
   - worktree exists but you're elsewhere → `cd` into it in the current session;
   - worktree gone but branch exists → recreate it via the active `worktree-management` flavor's `create` for `<branch>` off `<base>`, then work there;
   - branch also gone → fresh start off the repo default branch (per SPEC); the store's progress is your restart baseline.
3. Reconcile base per SPEC Restack reconciliation — if the active `forge` flavor's `pr-status` base differs from the unit's recorded base, realign and append a `restack` line.
4. Load state: read `charter.md` (why this unit exists + its `design:`), `progress.md` (Tasks + Follow-ups), and `log.md` (recent notes); run `git log -5` and the repo's verification command to confirm the code state.
5. Detect the unit's state and take the one right next action — **announce it first, then act.** Actions are conditioned on the state, so re-running is safe: it never repeats a finished step, and it writes to the store only on a genuine transition (never a bare "resumed" line — see SPEC idempotency note).
   - **Blocked-awareness guard:** before advancing (plan/execute/ship), derive the unit's needs — implicit base + `## Needs` (SPEC §Dependencies). If any is unmet, the unit is **blocked**: surface it — name the unmet target(s) and warn the unit is blocked — then require explicit confirmation to proceed anyway. `ws-resume` is the intentional override path: it warns, it does not silently proceed, and it does not hard-refuse.
   - **Unplanned** (`## Tasks` empty): read `charter.md` and its `design:` spec, note what the base branch already ships (build on it, don't redo it), then plan via the active `spec-driven-development` flavor's `plan` (SPEC §Flavors) — write the tasks as `T1..` into `progress.md`. Then proceed as "in progress".
   - **In progress** (some `T#` unchecked): continue at the first unchecked task via the active `spec-driven-development` flavor's `execute` — then update `progress.md`, append decisions/notes to `log.md`, record follow-ups per SPEC "Follow-up placement" (deferred → `backlog.md`).
   - **Done** (every `T#` checked) **with no PR** (per the active `forge` flavor's `pr-status`): the work is finished but unshipped — ship it via the active `spec-driven-development` flavor's `ship` (which opens the PR via the `forge` flavor's `pr-create` + `pr-ready`).
   - If a `stacked-on` unit is not yet merged (per the active `forge` flavor's `pr-status`), surface it and let the user decide before proceeding.

## Next
After the action, `ws-next` — it runs from any session; offer to run it now (default yes) (SPEC Next-step chaining).
